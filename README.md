Instructions:

To create a 'region' click in the dark grey space and press 'r' on the keyboard.

This will then create a new region with it's own piano roll. 

To resize this region place the mouse inside it and press '1' or '2' on the keyboard.

To move the position of the region click and drag it.

To create notes click in the piano roll window and press 'n' on the keyboard.

Each region has it's own piano roll which can be opened clicking inside the orange region and pressing 'o' on the keyboard.

The number of bars slider selects how many bars the sequence will play for.

The oscillator selector can select between a saw, sine, or square wave for that entire track.

To delete either a note region (pink) or sequence region (orange) click in the square and press d.

There is currently a bug so sequence regions cannot be deleted.
